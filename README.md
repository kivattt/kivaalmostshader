# KivaAlmostShader
This is not a shader, it scales vertex colors in `Tesselator.java`

# Commands
`/shader` - Toggle the "shader"\
`/colortint` - Toggle the color tint, keeping only the increased contrast\
`/brightershadows` - Toggle vanilla shadows basically

# Known issues
- Stuff will just go fullbright and flashbang you in your menus sometimes
- Makes some menus look darker
- Commands does not toggle immediately, it's kind of like changing your gamma
- Tints everything slightly pink/purple (not a bug, it's a feature!) (`/colortint` to disable)
