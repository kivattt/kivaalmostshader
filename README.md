# KivaAlmostShader
This is not a shader, it scales vertex colors in `Tesselator.java`

# Commands
`/shader` - Toggle the "shader"

# Known issues
- Makes some menus look green-ish
- `/shader` does not toggle immediately, it's kind of like changing your gamma
- Tints everything slightly pink/purple (not a bug, it's a feature!)
